# Drug toxicity prediction

As a specialist in in silico drug-induced human toxicity modeling, I have developed predictive models focusing on hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity. These models leverage computational techniques to simulate and predict adverse drug reactions, enabling early-stage identification of potential toxicities during drug development.

Through data-driven approaches such as machine learning, molecular modeling, and systems biology, I create highly accurate models to predict toxicity outcomes. These models are built on large-scale biological datasets, including chemical structure-activity relationships, gene expression profiles, and clinical toxicity data.

## Motivation
Predictive toxicity models play a critical role in modern drug discovery. With high rates of failure in clinical trials due to unforeseen toxic effects, these models allow pharmaceutical companies to identify compounds with potential safety issues earlier, saving time, resources, and improving the likelihood of success in later stages of development.

## Model Building
The models leverage machine learning, Deep learning, NLP, Graph Nural Networks(GNN) technique approaches to predict toxicity outcomes. Data is sourced from publicly available toxicity datasets, chemical structure libraries, and biological databases. Key features considered include chemical structure, ADMET profiles, gene expression data, and physicochemical properties.

## Feture Development
Future work will focus on expanding the toxicity prediction models to cover additional endpoints such as nephrotoxicity and immunotoxicity. We are also working on incorporating real-world clinical data to further improve the models' predictive accuracy. Collaboration with industry partners is welcome for model validation in real-world drug development scenarios.

To deploy this project on [render]([https://dashboard.render.com/](https://streamlit.io/))

```bash
  app.py
```


## Demo

Below is the domo for created application

## Live demo

## Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project . If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. I'm working on blog about this mini project and I'll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)

- Data gathering
- Descriptive Analysis
- Data Visualizations
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Modelling
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment
## Technical Aspect
- Using PowerBI dekstop create the report.
- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
- Building and hosting a Flask web app on Render.
- A user has to put details like ram, battry power, Pixel resolution Height etc .
- Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
app=Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def page():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


## Dataset
Now we can download the dataset on Kaggle and make analysis for it. Kaggle is the one of the largest website have to provide the datasets on verious domain.

## Lessons Learned

Now the bulding that project i can learn the concept of how to create the web in HTML and how to desing that page well attractive. Also i can get the tainled knowlaged about the render to how exactly deploy the model on cloud.

In challanges my mesure challange is that how to select the best feature they are highly affected my responce.
and selection of the best model to improve the accuracy.
